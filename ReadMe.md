## Description
A secure, open-source, lightweight and completely offline desktop app solution for managing passwords

## Intended Users
### üîê Privacy-Conscious Users
* People who avoid cloud storage due to concerns over data breaches.
* Users who prefer local encryption over remote syncing.
* Those who don‚Äôt trust proprietary password managers (LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden Cloud).

### üíª Tech-Savvy & Open-Source Enthusiasts
* Linux users and self-hosting advocates.
* Developers and security researchers who prefer open-source software.
* People who like to audit and verify code for vulnerabilities.

### üè¢ Organizations with Strict Security Policies
* Companies that forbid cloud-based password storage for security reasons.
* Cybersecurity firms requiring air-gapped password management solutions.
* Government agencies, defense contractors, and critical infrastructure providers.

## Inspiration
Most password managers cost money, are closed-source and require internet connection (super sketchy). It is very important to trust your password managers, and what better way to build trust than reading the source code for yourself.
