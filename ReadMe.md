# Password Manager
![Build](https://github.com/davidwilliford99/PasswordManager/actions/workflows/maven-publish.yml/badge.svg)

A secure, encrypted and completely offline desktop app solution for managing passwords.

## Description
This is a personal project of mine. Upon the first public release, I will be making this open source and accept contributions. This is meant to offer a completely offline and open-source password manager. In modern times, it is very unsafe to use the same password for every account you have. Database leaks happen ALL OF THE TIME. So it's important that your accounts are all decoupled, using different passwords that are stored locally.

## Inspiration
Most password managers cost money, are closed-source and/or require you to connect to the internet to use them. It is very important to trust your password managers. And if you can read each line of code, you can spot any vulnerabilities and fix them yourself. I selected to use Java since my application will be able to run on any machine that has the JVM installed.
